                <p>Singaporean history can be divided into several distinct periods. The earliest recorded history dates back to the 3rd century, when the island was known as Temasek. According to legend, a Sumatran prince named Sang Nila Utama landed on the island and saw a creature that he believed to be a lion. He named the island Singapura, which means "lion city" in Malay. The island remained a small trading port for several centuries.</p>

                <p>In the 14th century, Singapore came under the influence of the powerful Srivijaya empire, which controlled a large part of Southeast Asia. In the early 15th century, Singapore fell to the Majapahit Empire, which was based in Java. The island continued to be an important trading center, attracting traders from China, India, and the Middle East.</p>
                    
                <p>In 1819, the British East India Company established a trading settlement on the island, which they named Singapore. The settlement grew rapidly, attracting immigrants from China, India, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Singapore became a center of trade and commerce, with a thriving port and a diverse population.</p>
                    
                <p>During World War II, Singapore was occupied by the Japanese, who used the island as a base for their operations in Southeast Asia. The occupation was brutal, and many civilians were killed or subjected to forced labor. After the war, Singapore became a British colony again, but the island's people began to demand independence.</p>

                <p>In 1959, Singapore became a self-governing state within the British Commonwealth, with Lee Kuan Yew as its first prime minister. He focused on building a modern economy and creating a strong national identity. He encouraged foreign investment, developed the port, and established policies that favored education and innovation.</p>

                <p>In 1965, Singapore gained independence from Malaysia, becoming a sovereign state. Lee continued to lead the country until 1990, overseeing a period of rapid economic growth and social development. Singapore became one of the wealthiest and most technologically advanced nations in Southeast Asia.</p>
