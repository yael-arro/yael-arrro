                <p>Singapore is a small island country located in Southeast Asia. It is one of the only countries in the world to be both a city and a country. It is can be found the the southernmost tip of the long and thin Malaysian peninsula. It is made up of one main island, known as the Singapore Island or Pulau Ujong, with about 62 other minor surrounding islands, including the famous Sentosa Island and the forested Pulau Ubin. It is located just 1 degree north of the equator, so it has a tropical rainforest climate. The island is connected to Johor Bahru, Malaysia, by bridges that span over the Johor Strait. The Singapore Strait, located south of Singapore, is often the first body of water that Singaporean business ships cross by.</p>

                <p>Singapore does not really have "towns" in the traditional sense, but rather townships or really just neighborhoods. Examples of these neighborhoods are Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Woodlands, and Jurong East/West. The most famous and iconic Singaporean neighborhoods are Marina Bay, Orchard, Chinatown, Little India, Bugis, and Clarke Quay. One of the distinctive features of these neighborhoods is their emphasis on greenery and sustainability. For example, the neighborhood of Punggol, one of the newer neighborhoods, has been designed to be a "green and sustainable" town, with solar panels, rain gardens, and energy-efficient lighting.</p>
