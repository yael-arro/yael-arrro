            <!--Main Article-->
            <p>There are four main races and languages in Singapore:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>English</li>
                <li>Chinese (Mandarin)</li>
                <li>Malay</li>
                <li>Indian (Tamil)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These races/languages were also chosen to be the four national races/languages of Singapore. Here is why:</p>

            <p>The English, or the British, colonized Singapore in the 18th and 19th century. Because of this, many Europeans came to Singapore to find a living. And even now, though not quite commonly, you can find Europeans, Americans, and other foreigners in Singapore. And also, since English is the language with the most speakers, the government decided to make English one of its national languages.</p>

            <p>The Chinese maked their way to Singapore since even before Sang Nila Utama landed in Singapore. The government decided to make Chinese, more specifically Mandarin Chinese, to be one of its national languages because of two reasons: the Chinese are the largest group of people living in Singapore and is still growing, and the government wanted to prepare Singaporeans since in the future, Chinese was supposed to replace English as the language with the most speakers.</p>

            <p>The Malays no doubtedly went to Singapore because it was and is its very close neighbor, and because it was once part of Malaysia. Malay was also once the main language of Singapore. Malay is one of Singapore's national languages also because of two reasons: Malaysia's rich history with Singapore, and the government wanted to keep the Malays' cultural heritage.</p>

            <p>The Indians, mostly from the state of Tamil Nadu, first came to Singapore during the British colonization as traders and seamen, then soon lived there. Indian, more specifically Tamil, is also part of Singapore's national languages mainly also because of the government wanting to keep the Indians' cultural heritage and because of the big number of them living in Singapore.</p>

            <p>But even after all these languages, Singaporeans had eventually come up with a "language" based on these four languages. This "language" is called Singlish. It is definitely what you think it is: Singaporean English. It is mostly English mixed with words, mostly slang words, from Chinese, Malay and Indian. For example: </p>

            <p>Singlish: <em>Dey, wo men paktor always makan at kopitiam one leh.</em></p>
            <p>English: <em>Hey, whenever we date, we always we eat kopitiam one, and I'm tired of it.</em></p>
