            <!--Main Article-->
            <p>Singapore has grown to become a 1st world country in the world. This was because of its tremendous development in a quite short amount of time. Since its independence from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore was merely just a trading post. In this interesting history of development, there would no doubt be something, whether futuristic or plain old, to remind Singaporeans of how far they have come.</p>

            <p class="title-p">Marina Bay Sands</p>
            <p>Probably the most famous and most iconic attraction is the Marina Bay Sands, and more specifically, the hotel there. It appears as three towers, with a boat balancing on top of them. It was first opened to public in June 2010, after construction. Other than being a hotel, it has been used to house restaurants, casinos, and it even has the world's highest infinity pool.</p>

            <p class="title-p">The Merlion</p>
            <p>One of the most famous attraction of Singapore history is the Merlion. The Merlion is a statue of a creature with the head of a lion and the tail of a fish. The Merlion is based on Sang Nila Utama, who claimed to see a <em>lion</em> in the <em>fish</em>ing village of Temasek. After several relocations, the Merlion can now currently be seen just opposite of the MBS hotel, overlooking Marina Bay.</p>

            <p class="title-p">Gardens by the Bay</p>
            <p>Another iconic attraction located along the Marina Bay area is the Gardens by the Bay. This attraction features mainly several huge manmade supertrees and two domes: the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Gardens by the Bay is used to symbolize the country's vision for the future to make a "city in a garden."</p>

            <p class="title-p">Jewel Changi Airport</p>
            <p>Jewel mall in Changi Airport is often the first and/or last attraction tourists go to, since its already at the airport. This mall is really famous for its huge waterfall feature at its center. In here, you can find many restaurants, shopping places, and cinemas. It even features a mirror maze, a dinosaur quest, and a net where you can walk above a really tall height.</p>

            <p class="title-p">Sentosa</p>
            <p>&ldquo;While the city is for adults, Sentosa is for the kids.&rdquo; - as they often would say. Sentosa features everything you would expect in a resort or theme park: rides, beaches, hotels, plus a water park, an aquarium, and even a Merlion of their own. You can also find the famous Universal Studios Singapore and the Resorts World Singapore.</p>

            <p>Singapore has much more attractions waiting to be seen. Whether they are famous or not, they all are certainly worthy to be at least heard about.</p>

            <p class="table-p">Here are the attractions of Singapore and how much is the entry fee per person. The ones not listed here are probably (not all) free. :3</p>
